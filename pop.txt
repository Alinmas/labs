Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I, I just want real love
Said I gotta have real love
Everything can, you be everything that I dream of"

I Wanna Love You Forever
                
You set my soul at ease 
Chased darkness out of view 
Left your desperate spell on me 
Say you feel it to 
I know you do 
I've got so much more to give 
This can't die, I yearn to live 
Pour yourself all over me 
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees 

[CHORUS]
I wanna love you forever 
And this is all I'm asking of you 
10,000 lifetimes together 
Is that so much for you to do? 
Cuz from the moment that I saw your face 
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace 
I swear I knew. 
I'm gonna love you forever 

My mind fails to understand 
What my heart tells me to do 
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you 
and that would do 
I've always been taught to win 
And I never thought I'd fall 
Be at the mercy of a man 
I've never been 
Now I only want to be right where you are. 

[CHORUS]

In my life I've learned that heaven never waits no 
Lets take this now before it's gone like yesterday 
Cuz when I'm with you there's nowhere else 
That I would ever wanna be no 
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you 
Loving me ... I'm gonna love 

[CHORUS]"
"I'm sorry I didn't mean to call
But I couldn't fight it
I guess, I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrender just to hear your voice

I know, how many times I said I'm gonna to live with out you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something baby that you need to know
That deep inside me I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Carino mio, my world becomes so empty

My day's are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain.
I wish, I could tell you I'm feeling better every day
That it didn't hurt me when you walked away

But to tell you the truth I can't find my way
And deep inside me I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Carino mio, my world becomes so empty"
"When I get you all alone
I'm gonna move in nice and close
Ain't nobody gonna interrupt my game
Oh, no, no

Ever since you've been hanging around
I've been trying to figure out
What I can say to you to get some play, yeah

Can we do, what we did last night again
Baby, you and I'd be better friends
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further?
Oh yeah, yeah

Every night when we say goodbye
I can't help looking in your eyes
Wondering why you and I haven't hit it
Can we get it on?

I'm kinda faded but I feel alright
Thinking about making my move tonight
I can't pretend that you're only my friend
When you're holdin' my body tight

â€~Cause I like the way you're making your move
I like the way you're making me wait
At the end of the night when I make up your mind
You'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know you got it
And you know I want it
I can't wait to take you home

I don't want to be rude at all
I just want to be where you go
Think what we could do alone, yeah, yeah

Can we do, what we did last night again?
Baby, you and I'd be better friends
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further?
Oh, yeah

You'll be coming on home with me

Uh, uh , when we first met, yo that deal was stated
You stepped like my steez, the way we compensated
Just another day around the way
With me up close and everything okay

'Cause I'm not like the rest, indecision with the best
Thoughts for my full court press
Because they hated
How's it go? Hah, yo faded

I'm kinda faded but I feel alright
Thinking about making my move tonight
I can't pretend that you're only my friend

"""Never look back"", We said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear all my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know?
Still I miss you somehow

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose

From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

""Baby,"" I said, ""Please stay""
Give our love a chance for one more day, oh
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose

From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

You promised yourself but to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose

From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place
Till she looked into my eyes

Shook your hand around 9 p.m.
And I'm never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

Shooby-doo-wop and scobby snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy, I think I fell for the girl on TV

I don't want her autograph
I just wanna call her up and make her laugh

Yeah, so I wish for you on a bright shining star
Every where I look, there you are, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress, she took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for a better day

I had pictured us together
Now to feel your lips on my fingertips
I have to say is even better

From all of my sadness the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever

On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Flowing inside me like never before

A special feeling just burst inside
There was only you, nobody else

Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now

Didn't tell you this tonight

And now you're back inside my house again
I'm trying deeply to explain
'Cause baby, I wanna get it on
And baby, you're the one for me

And now that I have got you all alone
After all this talking on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you belong

So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Tryin' hard to fill the emptiness, the piece is gone
Left the puzzle undone, ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do
No matter what we do
(No matter what we say)
No matter what we say
(We're the song that's outta tune)
(Full of beautiful mistakes)

(And everywhere we go)
And everywhere we go
(The sun will always shine)
The sun will always, always shine!
  (But tomorrow we might awake on the other side)

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today"

"If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through and I hope
You are the one I share my life with

I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there anyway that I can stay in your arms?

If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance name my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through and I hope
You are the one I share my life with

And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray that you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there anyway that I can stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss your body and soul so strong
That it takes my breath away
And I breath you into my heart
And I pray for the strength to stand today

'Cause I love you whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
And though my heart is by your side

I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there anyway that I can stay in your arms?"

"So, what am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Making up a few false rumors or two

That for sure is not a man to me
Slandering names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder

Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So, what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringing?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
'Cause you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore


I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder

Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Check it, here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give us some head and sex her off
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore


But the table's about to turn, I'll bet my fame on it
Can't take my ideas and put their name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving

To all my girls with a man who be trying to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

You're just a little boy, think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder

"After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end I wanna thank you
'Cause you made that much stronger

Well I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff
Time is up, 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm hmm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that
I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all
That you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so, you could cash in on a good thing
Before I'd realized your game

I heard you're going 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feelin' I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hurt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, uh uh, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I know
Turn out to be unjust so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies
Disguise yourself through
Living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter
  (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop
  (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought I would forget
But I, I remember
Yes I remember
I'll remember

Thought I would forget
But I remember
Yes I remember

If so baby can I get 'em super sized

Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She start feelin' on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
What instead of one lifestyle I need 2

Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue

You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

"Baby can't you see 
I'm calling 
A guy like you should wear a warning 
It's dangerous 
I'm falling 
There's no escape 
I can't wait 
I need a hit 
Baby give me it 
You're dangerous 
I'm loving it 

Too high, can't come down 
Losing my head 
Spinning 'round and 'round 
Do you feel me now 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic, I'm slipping under 
Tasting the poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

It's getting late to give you up 
I took a sip 
From my devil cup 
Slowly taking over me 

Too high, can't come down 
It's in the air 
And it's all around 
Can you feel me now? 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic, I'm slipping under 
Tasting the poison paradise 
I'm additcted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic, I'm slipping under 
Tasting the poison paradise 
I'm additcted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic, I'm slipping under 
Tasting the poison paradise 
I'm additcted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

Intoxicate me now 
With your loving now 
I think I'm ready now 
Intoxicate me now 
With your loving now 
I think I'm ready now"
"Ha, haa
Ha, haa

The real me is a southern girl with her Levi's on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl
Real me is to laugh all night lyin' in the grass just talkin' about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinkin' about it, almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
With you

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you, with you, with you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowin' you found me

'Cuz I'm still thinkin' about it, I almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cuz with you

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothin' but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you, with you, with you

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you"
"Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers
When our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby

And everytime
I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby

And everytime
I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song is my sorry

At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby

And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby"
"Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself

â€~Cause I didn't know you
â€~Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
â€~Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, â€~cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me

""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep
(Too deep)
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""

And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
And it's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together

Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together"
"Mm uh mm yeah
Mm mm yeah yeah yeah

Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the makeup on his shirt

You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man

Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection

Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you, love you, yeah
Listen

Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth

Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control, baby you know
If I was your man

(Baby you'd)

Never worry 'bout

I gotta shake it off

By the time you get this message

Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say, ""I told you so""

But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

Who loves you more than me

Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home

La Tortura
[Shakira:]
AAaaay... AAaaay... 
Busca a otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adios

No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos y hablando de ella

Ay amor me duele tanto 

[Sanz:]
Me duele tanto

[Shakira:]
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay amor fue una tortura... 
Perderte

[Sanz:]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo 
Pero no puedo arreglarlo

No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Sólo de errores se aprende 
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

Busca a otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adios

Con siete velas te invocaré

Cosita bella, coje otra vela

AAaaay...
Busca a otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adios

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que te den peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Ni andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

[Sanz:]
Ay amor me duele tanto, me duele tanto 
Que no creas más en mis promesas

[Shakira:]
Ay amor

"Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me, I can find no rest
Where I'm goin' is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go
  (Alone)

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete
Incomplete"
"Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same, ohh, baby, no
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go
I just broke down
(Down)

Baby, if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice
'Cuz the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right

It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me
Right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything

That's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you, baby

That's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you, baby

Break it down now, I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you it's been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat, every time we speak
I can't believe I feel so weak

Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you, I'll put it down be the woman for you
I'm falling so deep for you crazy over for you

I`m calling, calling out to you what am I going to do?
It's true and no fronting
Its you and no other I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down
(Down)

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch

I want to be what you always needed

Am I crazy for wanting you?
Maybe, do you think you could want me too?
I don't wanna waste your time
Do you see things the way I do?
I just wanna know that you feel it too
There is nothing left to hide

"These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
Is who I am, is what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you

I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know

Waste bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines

You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you

I'm getting off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Waste bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flown
Don't you know?
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you

These words are my own
They're from my heart
I love you, I love you

That's all I've got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say
I love you, is that okay?"
"You're lookin' just a little too hard at me
You're standing' just a little too close to me
You're sayin' not quite enough to me
You're sippin' just a little too slow for me

No doubt you playin' real cool homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me?
Trippin' a little more than I should be
So let your self go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
We can get right

Do you want more?
Do you want more?
Do you want more?
Do you want more?

You lips talkin' bout I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips movin' oh so slow
Bar tab lookin' like a car note

All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
We can get right

So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind
Baby take my hand, I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up
We can get right, get right

"I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined

I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines

We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, no

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa
(Shakira, Shakira)

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto

I know I'm on tonight my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
(Shakira, Shakira)

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dÃ­a
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dÃ­a

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man want to speak Spanish

Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

SeÃ±orita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it!
Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates
For Humpty Humpty we need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
[Incomprehensible]
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I'm on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
No fighting"

I've got trouble, trouble, trouble
Always knocking at my door

Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes, you know sometimes
It'd be like that, baby, yeah

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride

Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know, nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it, how good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny

So, baby, we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody

"Last night, I couldn't even get an answer

I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

Lean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more

I knew when I ran into this one
She would be the red rum of my pimpin'
Knew she would be the one to make me stop carin' about other girls
On my jock and gettin' 'em
She was the one to slow me down, hold me down
I roll wit her know, go wit it now
I'ma grow wit it now, I'ma go get her that's how

'Coz I got somethin' to say 'bout it
What I'm about to say is straight up real talk
No cut, I don't play 'bout it

I wanna give her the world and I ain't even tryna lose her

That she twirls in that little skirt
Just for me in the club, in the crib, in the streets
She reps for L B Dub
E N T, she a nice size with the pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a winner wit the right prize

I'ma give it to her to the rhythm of a hi-hat
She got a beautiful mind, you can't buy that
And the sight from behind when she walk on by
Make a *** wanna try that

She got the prettiest smile and she gangsta
Keep me from runnin' wild and I thank her
And we can talk about anything
She got good conversation, my homie
Little friend and plus she patient

[Chorus]"
"I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglees in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under the covers stayin' safe and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

What am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just, mmm

It starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tucked me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, where ever you go
Wherever, wherever, where ever you go"
"You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh, that's right

I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
â€~Cause they're all wrong

I know better
â€~Cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no no

I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you a friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
For they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong

But they knew better
Still you said forever and ever
Who knew? Yeah yeah

I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
â€~Cause they're all wrong

And that last kiss I'll cherish
Until we meet again
And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember

But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?

My darling
My darling, who knew?
My darling I miss you
My darling, who knew?

Who knew?"
"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"
"Damn, I mean, I just keep thinkin' about you
I mean, I wanna move on but I can't move on
It's like you got some kinda hold on me and, man I don't know
But I'ma go ahead and talk about it, listen

I'm sittin' lookin' out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You're still runnin' through my mind
When I'm knowin' that you shouldn't be
Me all on your mind and I'm knowin' that it couldn't be

'Cause you ain't called and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lotta pain, I ain't dealt wit it all
I been runnin' 'round with other chicks, I'm single and they lovin' it
I'm likin' it but I just want the one that I was in love with

That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know
You got a hold or some kinda control of me
I don't know what it is but I gotta get you gone from me

I'm workin' at it and it ain't gettin' no better
Just tryna be like, yeah, forget it, whatever
Instead of starin' out this glass, lookin' at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together 'cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system

And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you outta my system

I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you can call that
And when I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me

It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin', where you at or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin' me, â€½Just let her go, Bowâ€
Believe me, I'm tryin', man, I just don't know how

I be in all the top spots, leavin' with the hot shots
Knowin' they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin'
Thinkin' who she with or where she goin', is she club hoppin'?

I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealin' with this kind of fight
It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right 'cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system

And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you outta my system

Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been runnin' through my mind all day, can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time, that's what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been runnin' through my mind all day, can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time and it kills me

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system

And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you outta my system

I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did

But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
It's still hard and I still love you to this day
Peace"

Lovestoned
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

[Chorus 1:]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[instrumental break]

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh [repeat 2 more times]

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh"
"Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking around
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goalIs to keep me from falling

But nothing's greater than the rush
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh, they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see

I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love"
"Head under water and they tell me
To breathe easy for awhile
The breathing gets harder, even I know that

Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well
But you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you to stay
All you have is leaving
I'm gon' need a better reason
To write you a love song today, today

I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
My heavy heart sinks deep down under

You and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me you'll leave the light on
To help me see daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this

Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute

Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today, today"
"I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, oh oh oh
Do what you want but you're never gonna break me
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, oh oh oh

Take me away, a secret place
A sweet escape, take me away
Take me away to better days
Take me away, a hiding place

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, oh oh oh

Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, oh oh oh

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, oh oh oh
Wish that you could but you ain't gonna own me
Do anything you can to control me, oh, oh no

Take me away, a secret place
A sweet escape, take me away
Take me away to better days
Take me away, a hiding place

There's a place that I go that nobody knows
Where the rivers flow and I call it home
And there's no more lies in the darkness there's light
And nobody cries, there's only butterflies

Take me away, a secret place
A sweet escape, take me away
Take me away to better days
Take me away, a hiding place

Take me away, a secret place
A sweet escape, take me away
Take me away to better days
Take me away, a hiding place

Take me away
  (I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine)
A secret place
  (I got a love and I know that it's all mine)
To better days take me away
Take me away
  (I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine)
A secret place
  (I got a love and I know that it's all mine)
Take me away, a hiding place

The sun is on my side and takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be alright
The sun is on my side and takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be alright"
"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it

I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what, good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused

Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it

The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it"
"I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglees in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under the covers stayin' safe and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

What am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just, mmm

It starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tucked me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, where ever you go
Wherever, wherever, where ever you go"

I'll hug your body tighter than a pair of your jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in a Caribbean sea

"I was ridin' shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart

I look around
Turn the radio down
He says
""Baby, is somethin' wrong?
I say
""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slammin' screen door

Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window

When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow

'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home
'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he

Could play it again
I was walkin' up
The front porch steps

After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
Or been trampled on
And lost
And thrown away

Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice

All the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow
'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home
'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something
To come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone
And he talks real slow
'Cause it's late
And his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home
before I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again
I was ridin' shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
"[Intro, x2]
Boys call you sexy (What's up, sexy)
And you don't care what they say
See, every time you turn around
They screamin' your name

[Verse 1]
Now I've got a confession
When I was young I wanted attention
And I promised myself that I'd do anything
Anything at all for the boys to notice me

[Bridge]
But I ain't complaining
We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what it's like to be nameless
Want them to know what your name is
'Cause see when I was younger I would say

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have Groupies

When I grow up
Be on TV
People know me
Be on magazines

When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

[Hook x2]
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
But you just might get it
But You just might get it

[Verse 2]
They used to tell me I was silly
Until I popped up on the TV
I always wanted to be a superstar
And knew that singing songs would get me this far

[Bridge]
But I ain't complaining
We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what it's like to be nameless
Want them to know what your name is
'Cause see, when I was younger I would say

I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it

[Verse]
I see them staring at me
Oh I'm a trendsetter
Yes this is true 'cause what I do, no one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me, watching me, and I know you want it

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star

"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"
"It's been the longest winter without you

I didn't know where to turn to

See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through
Going coming thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one

Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gonna be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to

It'll all get better in time
I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh

Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything

Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gonna be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too

It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes I will

Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time"

Oh, oh, never find a love like this

Well we go back so far swingin' in your backyard
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school, ooh, I really liked you
Must have been your attitude

And that's why you keep on runnin' in and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by, baby, now I know why
I keep comin' back to you

You're the only one that knows me, love it when you hold me
I'd never find a love like this, let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely, look at what you've shown me
I'd never find a love like this

When this life tries to keep us apart
You keep callin' me back to your heart, let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me, wrap you all around me
I'd never find a love like this

All the guys tried to take me, you're the one who saved me
I feel like I owe you my life
And as strange as it may seem, I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice

And that's why you keep on runnin' in and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by, it's not hard to know why
I keep comin' back to you

I'm so glad you found me, wrap you all around me
I'd never find a love like this

May never find a l-l-love like this
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
I sit here in this chair and I wish for you not to leave me now

My friends they always told me, not to make you my wifey
Man they was puttin' you down
And now they see we rollin', me and you, we strollin'
They don't wanna come around

Let me hear you say
You're the only one that knows me, love it when you hold me
I'd never find a love like this, let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely, look at what you've shown me
I'd never find a love like this

I'll be hitting all the spots that you ain't even know was there

Ha and you all ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home

Sex, love, pain, baby, I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister

Magazine, paper, girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle

Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get your fiend on

Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpot

"I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone

Ah, the sun is blindin'
I stayed up again
Oh, I am findin'

But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
'Cause I won't remember, save your breath
'Cause what's the use?

Ah, the night is callin'
And it whispers to me softly, ""Come and play""
But I, I am fallin'
And if I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

Spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round

'Til you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry 'never again'
Broken down in agony, just tryin' find a friend, oh, oh

I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside, you're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

"We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now

And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers

I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

Need that picture of you
It so magical, we'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans, garage glamorous

Ready for those flashing light

Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price, loving you is cherry pie
Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me

S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

"It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Hey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to kill

I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me

Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't

You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Okay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow

Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes

The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot

You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!

Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call

"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay?
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

We can dance until we die

Got a motel and
Built a floor out of sheets

"Been there, done that messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

I won't let you in again
The messages I tried to send
My information's just not going in

Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap

Been there, done that messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now, I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead

Do, do, do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid

Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh baby, your time is running out

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

Tonight is the night to let it go

I wanna see how you lose control

So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

So baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier, please?

I'm fightin' for this girl
On the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid
Sent her arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy

"You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'
""We're just friends,"" what are you sayin'?
Said ""there's another,"" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we're here together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring

And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us who could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks

She made my heart pound
I skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on a weekend
She know she got me dazin' 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin' but I just keep on sayin'

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

"You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
I can see it
I can see it now"

"Uh, uh, Young Money, yeah, yeah

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

"It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Hey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to kill

I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me

Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't

You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Okay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow

Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes

The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot

You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!

Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine

I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine"
"How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try

It comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you
Know who you are and to me it's exciting

"Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand, and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale, today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart, it's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale"
"Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked

So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

I hate to break it to you babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
Swear you know best

But you expect me to
Jump up onboard with you
Ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction, oh
But you'll never see

You're so busy making masks
With my name on it in all caps
You've got the talking down
Just not the listening

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?

All my life I've tried
To make everybody happy while I just hurt and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?

Let me hold your crown, babe"
